# Sorting-Algorithms-Visualiser
This web app was inspired by my work on sorting algorithm in my further maths A-Level lessons as well as my work on the colour pallette creator which used the chroma-js library. Wanting to create an animation pushed me to learn how asynchronous code is handled in javascript which was a very new challenge comming from python which has the easily accessible sleep function. The bubble sort was easy to make taking me about a week, however the quick sort took me significantly longer. It is the first time I have used recursion in javascript and it took me a while to get a working algorithm that sorted an array of values, however after doing this the largest problem I faced in this project occoured, trying to find a way to animate the recursive function. It took me a while however I finally had the idea of manipulating the order of the divs that I was using, I also decided that I would only colour in the objects that were currently being sorted, in my opinion this effectively displays the recursive nature of the application. I am very proud of how this has turned out and though there are small changes I could make to it, like updating how the bubble sort swaps divs (it swaps the colours of the divs rather than their position), I am happy to publish it has finished for the minute.

Main things learned from this project:
- Asynchronous javascript code
- Recursion in javascript
- More familiarity with how arrays are managed in javascript

UPDATES:
25/04/2021 -> I have changed the quick sort to darken cells not being focused on them rather than greying them out
